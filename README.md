You can use this dictionary to create a quiz application. Here's a simple example of how to use it:

```python
# Example usage
def take_quiz(subject):
    score = 0
    for i, q in enumerate(questions[subject], 1):
        print(f"\nQ{i}: {q['question']}")
        for option in q['options']:
            print(option)
        
        answer = input("Your answer (A/B/C/D): ").upper()
        if answer == q['answer']:
            print("Correct!")
            score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Wrong! The correct answer is {q['answer']}")
    
    print(f"\nYour score: {score}/{len(questions[subject])}")

# Test a subject
take_quiz("Mathematics")
```
